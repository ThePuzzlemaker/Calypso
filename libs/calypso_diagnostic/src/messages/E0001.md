A multi-line comment end (`*/`) was found without a corresponding begining
(`/*`).

Example:

```
some comment */ // ERROR: no beginning for multi-line comment
```

Multi-line comments must begin with a `/*` and end with a `*/`. For example:

```
/* some comment */
```

Note that comments can nest in Calypso. This means that you can do the
following:

```
/*
 * comment
 * /* nested */
 */
```

However, this means that nested comments must be closed. Thus, this is invalid:

```
/*
 * comment
 * /* nested // ERROR: no end for multi-line comment
 */
```
