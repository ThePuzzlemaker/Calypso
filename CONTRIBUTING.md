# Contributing to Calypso

Unfortunately, we do not have a guide that describes the internals of Calypso. However, there are some people that are willing to mentor new users on easy issues. Issues that have a mentor are tagged with `E-mentor`. If you'd like to be a mentor, look for issues that are marked as `E-needs-mentor`, and ping `ThePuzzlemaker` to claim the mentorship for that issue.
