# Introduction

This part of *The Calypso Book* is a more formal specification on how the Calypso programming language works. This reference is inspired by the Rust reference book, which has definitely gotten me through some tough binds when working on stuff with macros.

This reference also describes the basic overview of how the bytecode compiler and VM work, and the basic structure of the project.
