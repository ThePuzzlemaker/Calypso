# Introduction

This part of *The Calypso Book* is a guide on how to write code in Calypso.

Currently this guide will not describe the Calypso build system and command-line interface as those are not yet fully defined.

## Notation

Calypso code will be written in code blocks like this:
```
Hello! This is a code block!
```

Syntax highlighting will be added eventually, but as of now, these will just be plain text in a monospace font.

Things to look out for or further explanations of things may be provided in notes like this:
> Note: This is a note!

Or in warnings like this:

<div class="warning">

Warning: This is a warning. Oh no!

</div>
